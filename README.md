## Overview
funcMapper is an R package designed to visualise all user-defined functions in a given R script, along with any other user-defined functions they depend on. This tool helps users understand how functions are interconnected within a codebase.

It is especially useful for:
 - Developers new to a codebase who want to quickly understand how functions are used.
 - Teams working collaboratively, to track how newly added functions are being utilised.
 - Developers handing over a project, to provide a clear overview of function dependencies.

## Installation

Install the latest version of funcMapper from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("funcMapper")
```

## How to Use funcMapper 

**funcMapper(script_path, output_name, output_path, source = FALSE, cleanup_temp_file = TRUE)**

Arguments:

*script_path*: File path of the R script to analyse (must end with.R).

*output_name*: Name of the output HTML file (no need to include .html).

*output_path*: Directory where the HTML file will be saved (do not include a trailing /).

*source*: Whether to run the script to load functions into the global environment (default is FALSE; set to TRUE if needed).

*cleanup_temp_file*: Whether to delete the temporary script file used during mapping (default is TRUE; set to FALSE to retain it).

The function generates an interactive HTML file containing the function map, saved to the specified output_path.

## Example Output

Below is an example of the output generated by funcMapper. The map is saved as an HTML file and can be viewed in any browser.

In this example, the script ‘main_script.R’ is used as the entry point and is highlighted in red. The map shows how user-defined functions are interconnected. For instance, the function *funcG* is called by both *funcC* and *funcD*.

Note: You can run funcMapper on any script, not just the main script of a project. However, the script will be wrapped in a function during processing. If the script is already a function, it will be wrapped again.
